# This script starts multiple instances on a sample MQ application.
# This sample, amqsghac, is provided with the MQ SDK package.
# It was chosen because it uses the auto-reconnect feature of MQ which
# means the queue managers will automatically move a connection from
# this application between queue managers in a Uniform Cluster to
# achieve an even balance of connections from applications of the same
# name

# The application will connect using the details within the CCDT.JSON
# file which is found in the same directory as this script (once
# createCluster.sh has been run)
